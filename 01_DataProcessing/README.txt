This directory contains scripts that primarily download and aggregate the raw annual ACS microdata from 2011-2014 into CPUMA-level.  This directory also contains programs that process information pertaining to state political composition over time, the Census urban/rural classifications for each CPUMA, and each state's Medicaid expansion status. The output files from the 05 and 06 programs are available in the 01_ProcessedData folder. The analytic file created in the 06 program is the primary data used in the subsequent analysis. The inputs to each file (and intermediate output files) are available on request.
